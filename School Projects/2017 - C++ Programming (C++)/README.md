# C++ Programming (C++)

This was one of my first college-level programming courses. In it I learned basic principles of C++ such as: functions, polymorphism, operator overloading, recursion, pointers, and input/output streams.

# Projects

[**Rock Paper Sissors**](Rock%20Paper%20Sissors/)

A looping game of Rock Paper Sissors, played against the computer. Asks the user for an input, randomly generates a computer input, and compares the two to see who won.

[**Sales**](Sales/)

Loops through a table of sales data, prompting for an input to store in each cell. Computes the total for each row and column. Prints the table with the totals. Then, finds and prints the highest and lowest values.

[**Scores**](Sales/)

Prompts the user for number of scores to keep track of, then prompts for the scores. Calculates the average, and then displays the entered scores along with the average.

[**File Example**](File%20Example/)

Stores some student information in a struct and writes the structs to a file. Then, opens the file for reading and reads the information of a specific student. Prints out the student information or any errors opening the file.

[**Soccer Scores**](Soccer%20Scores/)

Prompts for a name, jersey, and score for a number of soccer players. Then displays the data in a table.

[**Employee Info**](Employee%20Info/)

Demonstrates instantiating objects with different constructors. 

[**Records**](Records/)

Keeps track of a records file, allowing the user to add a new record to the end, display any record, and edit any record.

[**Num Days**](Num%20Days/)

Uses operator overloading to allow NumDays objects to be added, subtracted, incremented, decremented, and printed to an output stream.

[**Cash Register**](Cash%20Register/)

Creates a list of items, then asks the user which item to buy and how many. Then validates the inputs and updates the list of items. This loops until the user quits.

[**Ship**](Ship/)

Demonstrates polymorphism by creating objects that inherit from the original Ship object. Also contains operator overloading of the less-than and greater-than symbols to compare the age of two Ship objects.

[**Customer Data**](Customer%20Data/)

Uses input and output stream operators to input or output a whole object at once. Creates two customers, then prints data associated with them. Then prompts to input data for a third customer and prints it as well.

[**Min Max**](Min%20Max/)

Demonstrates the use of templates to encapsulate data of different types with only one class.

[**Test Scores**](Test%20Scores/)

Prints a list of grades, and finds the average. Handles NegativeScore and TooLargeScore exceptions if a grade in the list is less than 0 or greater than 100.

[**Balanced Delimiters**](Balanced%20Delimiters/)

Goes through a string containing parentheses and braces, making sure that each starting paranthesis or brace has a matching ending paranthesis or brace, in the correct order.

[**Recursive**](Recursive/)

Uses recursion to calculate a number raised to an exponent, or to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and a given number.

[**Employee Binary Tree**](Employee%20Binary%20Tree/)

Implements a binary tree to store and search employee information.

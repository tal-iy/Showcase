# Computer System Organization (Assembly)

This course was designed to teach students how low level systems in computers work. I learned about the components of a CPU, how a computer interprets binary instructions, and how to write and compile programs in Assembly.

# Projects

[**Lab 0: Hello World**](lab0.asm)

This is my first assembly language program for this class. It prints a message on the screen.

[**Lab 0.1: Return Input**](lab0.1.asm)

Prompts the user to input an integer value, then prints the entered value to the screen.

[**Lab 1: Fahrenheit to Celsius**](lab1.asm)

Prompts the user to input a Fahrenheit value, then prints the value converted to Celsius on the screen.

[**Lab 2: Sum**](lab2.asm)

Prompts the user to input two integers, then prints the sum of the two inputs.

[**Lab 3: Tax**](lab3.asm)

Prompts the user to input the price of an item, then prints the sales tax and total price on the screen.

[**Lab 6: String Length**](lab6.asm)

Prompts the user to input a string, then counts the number of characters in that string and prints that number.

[**Program 1: Equation**](prog1.asm)

Prompts the user to input five integers, then calculates and prints the equation (a+b)-(c+d)*e, substituting the letters with the five input values.

[**Program 2: Largest Number**](prog2.asm)

Prompts the user to input three integers, then prints the largest of them on the screen.

[**Program 4: Count**](prog4.asm)

Prompts the user to input an integer value, then prints the digits from 1 to that number in a right justified columns format.

[**Program 5.1: Average Array**](prog5.1.asm)

Prompts the user to input 10 integer values, stores them in an array, displays the array, and then calculates and displays the average of the inputs.

[**Program 5.2: Min Max Resized Array**](prog5.2.asm)

Prompts the user for how many numbers to enter, prompt for that many integer values, stores them in an array, displays the array, and then find and displays the smallest and largest of the inputs.

[**Program 5.3: Min Max Array**](prog5.3.asm)

Prompts the user for 10 integer values, stores them in an array, and then finds and displays the smallest and largest of the inputs.

[**Program 6: Sort**](prog6.asm)

Prompts the user for 10 integer values, stores them in an array, and then sorts and displays the sorted array.

[**Program 7.1: Hex to ASCII**](prog7.1.asm)

Mask and Rotate. Prints ascii of 0x44434241.

[**Program 7.2: Hex to ASCII Looping**](prog7.2.asm)

Mask and Rotate using a loop. Prints ascii of 0x706F6F4C, "Loop" backwards.

[**Exam**](arrays.asm)

Loop through an array, requesting an integer input to store. Then, loop again, printing each stored value in the array.

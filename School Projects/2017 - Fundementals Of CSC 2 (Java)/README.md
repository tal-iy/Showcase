# Fundementals Of CSC 2 (Java)

This was a continuation of an introductory class to programming in Java. I learned how to implement and sort simple data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and binary trees.

# Projects

[**Deck Of Cards**](Deck%20Of%20Cards/)

Creates a data structure for holding a deck of playing cards. It has functionality to deal a number of cards from the deck, shuffle the deck, and to return information about the remaining cards in the deck.

[**Electronics**](Electronics/)

Demonstrates the use of polymorphism by making multiple classes extend another class. Instantiates a few different kinds of electronics and calls their overridden methods as well as their inherited methods from the Electronics class.

[**Ship**](Ship/)

Another demonstration of polymorphism by creating an interface and then implementing it in other classes.

[**Exception Classes**](Exception%20Classes/)

ExceptionClasses prompts for a password string, then validates it to make sure it is at least 8 characters long, has at least one lower case and one upper case letter, and has at least one digit. If the validation fails, throws an exception and prompts for another password.

[**Stack Temp**](Stack%20Temp/)

Uses generic types to implement a stack data structure.

[**Deck Of Cards Stack**](Deck%20Of%20Cards%20Stack/)

Combines the Stack Temp project with the Deck Of Cards project to store the cards in a stack rather than an array.

[**Linked List Example**](Linked%20List%20Example/)

Creates a linked list data structure using generic types.

[**Linked List Sorting**](Linked%20List%20Sorting/)

Implements methods for sorting a linked list using different sorting algorithms: selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort.

[**Binary Tree**](Binary%20Tree/)

Implements a binary tree data structure, including a way to print the tree contents in-order, pre-order, and post-order. Also implements an iterator to iterate through the tree.

[**Contact Directory**](Contact%20Directory/)

Creates a way to store and retrieve a list of contact details to and from a file. Implements the Serializable class to easily store the whole database directly to a file.

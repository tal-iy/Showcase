# Algorithm Development (Algorithms)

This course was designed to teach students how to take a problem and break it down into small steps to produce an algorithm. Algorithms were written in pseudo-code and displayed using flow charts.

# Projects

[**Assignment 1: Weekly Paycheck**](Assign1.pdf/)

Compute a weekly paycheck based on how many hours were worked and the hourly wage.

[**Assignment 2: Recipe Flowchart**](Assign2.pdf/)

Recipe for hot cocoa.

[**Assignment 3: Sale Price**](Assign3.pdf/)

Compute the discounted price, sales tax, and final cost of an item based on its original price.

[**Assignment 5: Math Equations Flowchart**](Assign5.pdf/)

Prompt for two numbers where the first is larger than the second and the second is not zero. Compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers.

[**Assignment 6: Weekly Paycheck 2**](Assign6.pdf/)

Compute a weekly paycheck and overtime based on how many hours were worked and the hourly wage. 

[**Assignment 7: Letter Grade**](Assign7.pdf/)

Determine a letter grade based on a numerical grade.

[**Assignment 8: Sentinel Controlled While Loop**](Assign8.pdf/)

Repeatedly asks the user to enter a grade or –1. When the user enters –1, computes the average of the grades entered and then displays that average.

[**Assignment 9: Max, Min, Average**](Assign9.pdf/)

Asks the user how many numbers they would like to enter. Then asks for the series of numbers and keeps track of the smallest, largest, and average of the numbers entered. Then prints out the average, smallest, and largest numbers.

[**Quiz 1: Largest of 3 Numbers**](Quiz1.pdf/)

Determine which is the largest of three numbers.

[**Quiz 2: Counter Controlled While Loop**](Quiz2.pdf/)

Prompts for a series of numbers and keeps track of running totals of odd values and of even values. Then displays the odd running total and the even running total.

[**Quiz 3: Days in a Month**](Quiz3.pdf/)

Prompts for the name of a month. Determines how many days are in that month. Then displays the number of days in that month.

[**Final: Guessing Game**](Final.pdf/)

Generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to enter a guess. If the guess is lower or greater than the random number, then it tells the user if it’s higher or lower. The game ends when the user enters a correct guess or inputs 10 incorrect guesses. Then asks the user to play again.

# Game Programming (C++)

This Game Programming class focused on the SDL library to draw 2D graphics. I learned how to create a window, draw animated sprites, move a view around a scene, draw tilemaps, play sounds, and use keyboard input.

# Projects

[**Lab 2: Sprites**](Lab2/)

Sets up an SDL window, draws a background, and then continuously draws two sprites at random positions.

[**Lab 3: Movement**](Lab3/)

Draws two spaceship sprites. Moves both spaceship sprites in opposite x directions, and wraps them around the screen when they reach an edge.

[**Lab 4: Animation**](Lab4/)

Draws an animated bat sprite. Moves the bat sprite in the x direction, and wraps it around the screen when it reaches the right edge.

[**Lab 5: Keyboard**](Lab5/)

Draws a background and a sprite. Moves the sprite in a random diagonal direction, and bounces it off the borders of the screen. Allows the user to change the sprites movement direction using the arrow keys. Does this until the window is closed or the escape key is pressed.

[**Program 1: Bounce**](Program1/)

Draws a background and a sprite. Moves the sprite in a random diagonal direction, and bounces it off the borders of the screen.

[**Program 2: Collision Input**](Program2/)

Draws a spaceship sprite. Moves the sprite using the arrow keys, and keeps it within the borders of the screen.

[**Program 3: Sound**](Program3/)

Draws two spaceship sprites. Moves one sprite using the arrow keys and the other using the WASD keys, and keeps them both within the borders of the screen, playing a sound when either one hits a border. Plays background music, using the Space key for play and pause, and the Tab key for stop.

[**Program 4: Pong**](Program4/)

Draws two paddle sprites, a moving ball sprite, and score text. Moves one sprite using the arrow keys and the other using the WASD keys, and keeps them both within the borders of the screen. Plays background music along with other sounds when the ball collides with a border of one of the paddles.

[**Program 5: Brick Breaker**](Program5/)

Shows a splash screen, draws a background, a grid of brick sprites, a HUD with the number of bricks left, lives, and game score, a paddle that's controlled by the left and right arrow keys, and a ball that bounces around and can be started with the space bar key. The game is paused with the ESC key.

[**Program 6: Views**](Program6/)

Draws a layered grid of tiles. The view is moved around using the arrow keys.

[**Program 7: Tilemap**](Program7/)

Draws a layered grid of tiles. The view is moved around using the arrow keys.

[**Program 8: Scene**](Program8/)

Draws a layered grid of tiles. Creates two moving entities that explode on contact with the player. The player is moved around using the arrow keys.

[**Midterm: Soccer**](Midterm/)

Shows a splash screen, draws a background, a HUD with the number of lives remaining and game score, a paddle that's controlled by the up and down arrow keys, and a ball that bounces around. The game is paused with the enter key and quit with the ESC key.

[**Final Project: Space Invaders**](FinalProject/)

Shows a splash screen, draws a HUD with the number of lives remaining and game score, a player space ship that shoots projectiles with the space bar key and controlled by the left and right arrow keys, and enemy space ships scrolling across the screen. The game is paused with the P key and quit with the ESC key.

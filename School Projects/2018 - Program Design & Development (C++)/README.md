# Program Design & Development (C++)

This course combined aspects from the Algorithm Development and C++ Programming classes. I learned how to first write an algorithm to solve a problem and then to implement the solution in C++.

# Projects

[**Lab 1: Hello World**](Lab01.cpp)

Prompt the User for a nickname and display messages.

[**Lab 2: Hello World 2**](Lab02.cpp)

Display my name, title and author of the last book I read, and my favorite animal.

[**Lab 3: Area of a Triangle**](Lab03.cpp)

Prompt the user for the width and height of a triangle, calculate the area of the triangle, and print out the area.

[**Lab 4: Parking Fee**](Lab04.cpp)

Prompt the user for the number of minutes parked in a parking garage, convert the time to hours and minutes, calculate the parking fee, and display the time and parking fee.

[**Lab 5: Fee Per Minute**](Lab05.cpp)

Prompt the user for a number of minutes. Then it will determine and display a fee based on the number of minutes.

[**Lab 6: Grade Average**](Lab06.cpp)

Prompt the user for a number of grades to enter. Then it will ask for a series of grades and calculate the average of those grades. Then display the average.

[**Lab 7: Score**](Lab07.cpp)

Repeatedly prompt the user for a number between 0 and 100 until a valid number is entered. Then display that a valid number was entered.

[**Lab 8: Initials**](Lab08.cpp)

Print out the initials "V", "X", and "S" as capital block letters made out of "*" characters.

[**Lab 9: Multiples**](Lab09.cpp)

Ask for two numbers, then determine whether the first number is a multiple of the second number. It will loop as long as the user enters a 'Y' or 'y' when asked to run again.

[**Lab 10: Array Average**](Lab10.cpp)

Ask for 10 grades, then will print the entered grades, compute the average of the grades, and print the average. Then, will generate 20 random integers between 1 and 50, print the generated numbers, and then calculate and print the average value of the generated numbers.

[**Lab 11: Array Search**](Lab11.cpp)

Generate an array of 20 random integers between 1 and 10. Then, will generate another integer and count the number of times it occurs within the array. Then will print the array, the target number, and the number of occurences. Will repeat as long as the user enters 'Y' when asked to generate another array.

[**Program 1: BMI**](Prog01.cpp)

Prompt the user for their weight and height, calculate their BMI, and print out the BMI.

[**Program 2: Ascending Numbers**](Prog02.cpp)

Prompt the user for three numbers, then determine the smallest, middle, and largest of those numbers, and displays them in ascending order.

[**Program 3: Inches To Centimeters**](Prog03.cpp)

Prompt the user for a range for a conversion table to display. Then will display a table of inches converted to centimeters using that range and in increments of 6. Will also make sure that the entered range is valid, where the ending value is more than 6 inches greater than the begining value, and the ending value is no more than 36 inches greater than the begining value.

[**Program 4: Minutes Elapsed**](Prog04.cpp)

Ask for a begining and ending times using military format, then will determine and print the total elapsed minutes between the ending time and the begining time.

[**Program 5: Height Conversion**](Prog05.cpp)

Ask for a height in feet and inches. Then will convert the height to meters and print it.

[**Program 6: Bubble Sort**](Prog06.cpp)

Generate an array of 20 random integers between 1 and 10. Then, will use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array. Then will print both the unsorted and sorted array.

[**Final: Average Grades**](Final.cpp)

Prompt the user for a number of grades to enter. Then it will ask for a series of grades and calculate the average of those grades. Then display the average.

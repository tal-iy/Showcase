# Software Engineering (PHP)

The goal of this class was to teach students how to design, implement, test, and deploy software. I also learned how to coordinate a large project within a group of people with different skills and programming backgrounds.

# Semester Project

Our team decided to produce a website that collects data from the CENTRO Bus system and displays it. The web-app would be used for the purpose of tracking the performance of CENTRO busses. The
objective is to have an app which can give the users a way to filter different buses and routes to show the average performance of those busses.

The website uses PHP to interface the web client to the database. The database is a mySQL server that periodically pulls bus information from CENTRO.

# Systems Programming (C)

This class focused on C and assembly language. I learned about the underlying functions of operating systems and programs. We looked at how cache, control flow, memory, and IO works.

# Projects

[**Lab 1: Binary Handler**](./Lab1/)

The first lab taught us how to convert numbers between decimal, binary, unary, and gammacode. This was an introduction to review C.

[**Lab 3: Cache**](./Lab3/)

This program reads a list of addresses in a file given by one of the parameters, sets up a cache with a size given by the parameters, and simulates access to each address in the file by using the cache.
Then it calculates the number of hits, misses, and the miss rate. It also determines the number of clock cycles that the chosen page replacement algorithm takes.

[**Lab 4: Tiny Shell**](./Lab4/)

The Tiny Shell program taught us how a command line shell is implemented. This was a partner project where we wrote a shell that can start jobs, send jobs to the backgroud, wake jobs, and kill running processes.

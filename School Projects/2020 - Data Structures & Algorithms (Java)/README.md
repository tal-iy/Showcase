[**Project 1: Feature Extractor**](Project1/)

The objective of this project is to implement the first part of a sentiment analysis program:
feature extraction. This assignment implements a function that takes a dictionary of words and a text
document and counts the number of occurrences of dictionary words within the text document. In the
process of completing this project, I learned how to store large amounts of data in a way that is easily
searchable. I ended up going with a custom hash table implementation where I hash words based on the
first character and put them in a doubly-linked list located at the hashed index in an array.

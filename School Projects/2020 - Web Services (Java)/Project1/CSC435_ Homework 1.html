<h1>CSC435: Homework 1</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>Homework 1 is your project description and a requirements specification document, as well as an introduction to Java servlets.</p>
<p>1. Think from the point of view of a human client who wants you to build a useful web application, and write a requirements specification document. Include as many details as you can.</p>
<p>In addition, you should specify the following technical information:
</p><ul>
<li>Back-end functionality: explain what the logic of your project is. This is the part that does the useful work.</li>
<li>Points of contact of the back-end with the outside world: define the interfaces to your logic.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Submit a <b>text</b> or <b>pdf</b> file with the above.
This document will naturally get more refined as we progress with the course, meaning that what you submit now is not cast in stone - it will be upgraded, and it can very well change later. I do expect you, however, to have a clear starting point.</p>
<p>2. Choose two of the end-points you identified in your project document, and build two Servlets that represent them. One of those should be stateful (i.e., it should store/retrieve user information in an object associated with the session), and the other---stateless.</p>
<p>Package your servlets as a web application (.war file) and deploy them in Tomcat. You have to demonstrate that your servlets are deployed and working as required for your hw1 demo.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your sources and your packaged application.</p>

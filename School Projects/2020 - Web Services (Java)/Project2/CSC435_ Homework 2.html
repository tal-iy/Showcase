<h1>CSC435: Homework 2</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>Homework 2 consists of implementing a service layer to your project, as well as consuming external services as needed.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://cs.oswego.edu/~alex/teaching/csc435/RESTful.pdf">document</a> pertaining to REST services on the course web page. It has some details that were not mentioned in class.</p>
<p>Write servlets and/or filters for a view layer to your application. This view layer will present your entire application functionality as a set of RESTful services. Use the JSON format by default, and do not forget to set the appropriate MIME type of your response:<br>
response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");</p>
<p>Do not forget to work with all related servlet methods, depending on the service endpoint you are providing: Get, Post, Put, or Delete.</p>
<p><strong>NB: if your req spec document had poorly specified endpoints / external services, now is the time to fix it.</strong> For some projects you may have to rethink your entire application and change its focus.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your sources and your packaged application in .war format.</p>
<p>Demo: I will want you to demonstrate that everything is deployed and working as it should. I will also want you to demonstrate compiling your sources by hand, and packaging your bytecode and configuration in a .war file by hand. Finally, I will want you to demonstrate being able to work with the AS from the command line. Basically, I'll want you to start with your sources and non-running AS and, without using an IDE, end up with a deployed working enterprise application.</p>

<h1>CSC435: Homework 3</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>In Homework 3 you will complete the design of the architecture of your application, complete its internal logic, and persist data directly to a db</p>
<p>Use the MVC pattern to split the architecture of your application between logic, presentation, and dispatch. Write additional servlets / filters as needed. Connect to the MySQL db to persist your data with simple SQL statements. Use the RESTful layer you created in HW2 as the view / presentation.</p>
<p>Create an accurate description of the data flow in your project in diagrammatic form. If you used MVC appropriately in HW2, this task should be very easy.</p>
<!--<p>Finally, make sure you do not use dummy data any more: at this point your model should be connecting to any external services you listed in your requirement specification, and consuming data provided by them.</p>-->
<p><strong>NB: if your req spec document had poorly specified endpoints / external services, now is the time to fix it.</strong> For some projects you may have to rethink your entire application and change its focus.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your sources, your packaged application in .war format, your MVC diagram, and an SQL dump of your database.</p>

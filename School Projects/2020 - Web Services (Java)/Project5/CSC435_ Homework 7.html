<h1>CSC435: Homework 7</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>This is your last homework, and your Dropwizard project submission. At this point your Dropwizard implementation should be complete and everything should be working appropriately. Now you have two weeks before the final submission to refactor your code base (without removing or breaking functionality) and add authentication.</p>
<p>Add authentication to your project. We will discuss OAuth2 in class, which is the appropriate way to go, but you can also add Basic HTTP and/or programmatic user/password. I will give extra credit if you use OAuth2.</p>
<p><b>NB: make sure that your project is RESTful</b>. Read the document on RESTful best practices and follow it religiously. (HATEOAS is not needed.)</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your archived (zip or tar.gz) project directory.</p>
<!--<p>You will showcase this version of your project during Finals' week, so make sure it looks good. You will also show interesting pieces from the previous implementations of your project.</p>-->
